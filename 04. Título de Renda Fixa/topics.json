        "Fixed income securities represent loans from investors to issuers, with profitability defined by term, interest rate, and payment method. They are classified based on the nature of the issuer (governments – federal, state, and municipal – or private institutions, both financial and non-financial), impacting credit risk assessment, and by maturity (short, medium, and long term), influencing investment strategies.",
        "The classification by maturity (short, medium, and long term) considers local economic conditions and influences pricing, sensitivity to interest rate changes, and investment strategies.  In Brazil, short-term securities like LTNs and CDBs may have maturities of less than one year, while long-term securities, like NTN-C, have a minimum term of 12 months. Internationally, instruments like Eurobonds have varying maturities.",
        "The form of interest payment (fixed-rate, floating-rate, or hybrid) defines the return calculation method and the investor's exposure to interest rate and inflation variations. Fixed-rate securities offer cash flow predictability, floating-rate securities offer inflation protection, and hybrid securities combine characteristics of both. The choice should align with inflation expectations, interest rates, cash flow needs, and risk tolerance.  Each type has distinct regulatory implications.",
        "The Brazilian fixed income market has a larger stock of government bonds compared to private bonds, but the secondary market turnover is relatively low and concentrated in the short term, reflecting investors' risk aversion. Regulation is essential to ensure liquidity and transparency.",
        "The National Treasury issues government bonds like LTN, NTN, and CFT. Financial institutions issue private securities like DI, CDB, and Financial Exchange Letters. Non-financial companies issue debentures and commercial papers. Companies and governments can also issue securities in the international market, such as Eurobonds."

        "Government bonds are issued by central administration bodies or other administrative entities to finance budget deficits, refinance public debt, or enable investments. They are subject to specific regulations regarding debt limits and fiscal management transparency. Federal bonds are the most common and safest, while states and municipalities issue State Treasury Bills (LFTE) and Municipal Treasury Bills (LFTM), respectively, subject to specific legislation.",
        "The pricing of government bonds involves defining a price based on the security's characteristics, the expected income flow (coupon payments), and the term (business days, calendar days), using specific calculation methods for each security. Trading involves defining a price by buyers and sellers based on these factors.",
        "Letras Financeiras do Tesouro (LFTs) are floating-rate bonds indexed to the accumulated Selic rate (the basic interest rate used by the Central Bank to control inflation). LFT-A pays an additional remuneration of 0.0245% p.m. Negotiation is done through a quotation representing a percentage of the Updated Nominal Value (VNA), reflecting the desired premium or discount rate. The calculation of the LFT quotation (COT) involves considering the Selic factor for the period between the base date (07/01/2000) and the settlement date.",
        "Letras do Tesouro Nacional (LTNs) are short-term fixed-rate bonds traded at a discount to their face value. The price (Po) is calculated by bringing the face value of the bond (R$1,000.00) to the present value using a discount rate, reflecting interest rate expectations and risk assessment.",
        "Notas do Tesouro Nacional (NTNs) are bonds whose redemption value is updated by indexers such as IPCA, IGP-M, TR, and exchange rate variation, paying semi-annual interest (coupons) on the updated nominal value (VNA). The quotation (COT) is calculated by discounting the expected payment flow (periodic coupons plus the final redemption). Specific series include: NTN-B (indexed to IPCA, with a 6% p.a. coupon on the VNA, adjusted since 07/15/2000); NTN-C (similar to NTN-B, but using IGP-M, adjusted since 07/01/2000, with a 6% p.a. coupon); NTN-D (indexed to the USD exchange rate); NTN-F (fixed-rate, with a fixed redemption value of R$1,000.00 and a 10% p.a. coupon); NTN-H (indexed to the TR).",

They represent an important source of long-term resources at a relatively low interest rate.  They can be fixed-rate (semi-annual interest payment with a linear interest rate) or floating-rate (interest rate defined at the beginning of each semester). Profitability is based on the interest rate of treasury bonds or Libor plus a premium determined by the term of the operation and the credit risk of the issuing institution.

        "Duration is a measure that determines the term of a synthetic (zero-coupon) bond whose cash flow produces a capital equivalent to all the (homogeneous or heterogeneous) cash flows of a portfolio. It allows measuring the impact of interest rate changes on bond prices and is understood as the bond's average term. For a zero-coupon bond, the duration is the time remaining until maturity. For assets with intermediate flows (bonds that pay interest coupons), duration is the weighted average of the terms, where the weights are given by the present value of the flow in relation to the price.",
        "Modified duration measures, in percentage terms, the effect on a bond's price of a change in the return rate. It is a measure of price sensitivity to changes in the interest rate, keeping maturity constant. It is calculated as duration divided by (1 + rate). The portfolio's modified duration is a weighted average of the modified durations of each individual security, where the weighting is the proportion of each security in the portfolio.",
        "Factors determining duration measures include: coupon rate (inversely related); principal amortization (inversely related); maturity (directly related); rate of return (inversely related); call and put clauses (decrease duration); and frequency of coupon payments (higher frequency decreases duration)."
